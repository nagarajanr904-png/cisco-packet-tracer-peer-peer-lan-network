Peer-to-Peer LAN Verification

Overview
This project demonstrates the configuration and verification of a basic Peer-to-Peer Local Area Network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Two workstations are connected through a Cisco 2960 Layer 2 switch and configured with static IPv4 addresses within the same subnet.

Network Topology
PC0 ───────── Switch0 ───────── PC1
     Fa0/1             Fa0/2

IP Addressing
Device| Interface| IPv4 Address| Subnet Mask| Default Gateway
PC0| FastEthernet0| 192.168.10.25| 255.255.255.0| 192.168.10.1
PC1| FastEthernet0| 192.168.10.26| 255.255.255.0| 192.168.10.1
Switch0| —| Default| —| —

Configuration

- Added two end devices (PC0 and PC1).
- Added a Cisco 2960 Layer 2 switch.
- Connected both PCs using Copper Straight-Through cables.
- Configured static IPv4 addressing on both workstations.
- Verified the physical links and network interfaces.

Verification

1. IP Configuration

The "ipconfig" command was used to verify the IPv4 configuration of PC0.

ipconfig

2. Connectivity Test

ICMP connectivity between PC0 and PC1 was verified using:

ping 192.168.10.26

Successful replies confirmed end-to-end communication within the local subnet.

3. ARP Verification

The ARP cache was inspected using:

arp -a

The presence of an entry for "192.168.10.26" confirmed successful IP-to-MAC address resolution.

Verification Summary

Test| Purpose| Result
"ipconfig"| Verify IP configuration| Successful
"ping"| Verify PC-to-PC connectivity| Successful
"arp -a"| Verify IP-to-MAC resolution| Successful

Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IPv4
- ICMP
- ARP
- Layer 2 Switching

Conclusion
The Peer-to-Peer LAN was successfully implemented and verified. Static IPv4 configuration, physical connectivity, ICMP communication, and ARP resolution were confirmed between PC0 and PC1 through the Layer 2 switch.
